# Advanced Cheatsheets with Quarto

This project is about creating advanced cheatsheets with Quarto, a powerful and flexible framework for creating documents and websites with R Markdown and other languages.

Quarto allows you to use different render engines, such as Pandoc, Jupyter, and Knitr, to produce various output formats, such as HTML, PDF, and Word.

With Quarto, you can create cheatsheets that are:

- **Professional**: Quarto supports LaTeX math, citations, cross-references, and many other features to create high-quality documents.
- **Modern**: Quarto supports interactive features, such as widgets, plots, and tables, that can enhance the user experience and engagement.
- **Pretty**: Quarto supports custom themes, templates, and styles, that can make your cheatsheets look attractive and consistent.
